# bits-and-pieces

This repo will serve as a collection of snippets from private projects.

## Projects

* eventTracker

   A simple solution for hiding an event registration form turned into a lesson on reusability, forethought, and more advanced JavaScript concepts such as closure and a JS approach to object orientation.
   
* Outlier States

   An assignment to find the standard deviation of a column in a tab delimited text file and then identify rows more than one standard deviation from the mean. A relatively simple Python script that became a lesson on memory.
